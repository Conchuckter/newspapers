# THE DAILY HAROLD: BLOODY BIBLE?

### In todays issue we I will be talking about bibles, if you are sensitive to any topics in this issue we recommend you stop reading immediately. 

#### Our story begins with Harold, our main character going for a walk around the station. The shift had just started and he was getting his things required for journalism ready. He grabbed some pens and paper when he decided to go to the chapel. On his way he found nothing out of ordinary, medbay was chaotic as it always is and there was the faint smell of farts in the air. When he finally made it to the chapel his was shocked by what he saw. 

#### The scene in front of him was like a frame from a horror movie. One lone bible, sat in the middle of the chapel amoungst the rows of pews soaked in a puddle of blood. He approached with caution as the wave of a rotting corpse hit him. He could still not make sense of the situation a nd decided to leave and find something more interesting to write about when it hit him. This was the perfect story! It had a little bit of everything, controversy, mystery and even a bit of horror! This was going to be big time hit! He then ran to tech storage and starting writing on his trusty laptop and thats the story of why your reading this steaming pile of crap of a newspaper currently.
