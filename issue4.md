### *Harold Mirza* (Eye Witness):
### It all started when I first got on-site, the station being Oshan Laboratory. I was walking around the station making my way to the NetCafe where I was going to do my writing. I was nearly there when I saw it, staring in through a window into the brig. 

### 20 Monkeys.

### Not your normal monkeys however, these monkeys wore prison jumpsuits, and were wielding chainsaws, as I watched frozen in shock I saw a security officer. Lying helplessly on the floor. Monkeys crawling around him. Blood soaked his armor and he was crying out to his fellow officers for help. Then the life finally left his eyes and with one last gasp he collapsed lifeless. I still can't believe those monkeys would do such a thing.
