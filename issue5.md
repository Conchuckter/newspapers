# THE DAILY HAROLD: A GAME OF ASSAULT

### Proudly sponsored by the *Oswald Smith Entertainment Provider Emporium*.

### This article contains violence and frightening descriptions, if you are sensitive to any of those topics we highly advise you to stop reading immediately.

#### Nearly everyone has heard of it and a good few have actually given it a go, boxing is an activity many enjoy as spectators and otherwise. However there comes a point where we must ask if making a game out of hurting eachother is really what we as the species that now rule the galaxies should be doing. This has gotten to the point where NT (NanoTrasen) has made it mandatory for there to be at least one fitness center with a boxing ring on all NT registered stations.

> #### Hey I'm Oswald Smith, your generic, fun loving SS13 entertainment provider or just as "The Clown" to some. Fellow clowns will know how frustrating losing your belongings can get, all it seems the crew finds funny these days is stealing an innocent EPs items, and it makes sense. Its funny as shit. However sometimes constantly losing your stuff can get tiresome and you need a place where you can quickly replace it, thats where the *Oswald Smith Entertainment Provider Emporium* comes in, O.S.E.P.E. for short. We get you whatever a clown is likely to lose quickly and at low cost of farting into a jar for my entertainment. So make sure to head down to the O.S.E.P.E. anytime you need a brand new set of stuff.

#### Recently I witnessed three healthy humans be killed in this sport while watching from the spectator camera, it truly showed me how vile boxing can be a brang me to the conclusion that we should have this game of assault outlawed from NT stations and everywhere else we can reach, because I believe that it would be making that little difference that makes this shithole a little bit nicer. 

#### But what do I know? I'm just a clown myself with a bunch of fake journalism degrees. So do what you want and if that involves beating eachother to death go right ahead, I won't stop you, I just make the shitty newspapers.
