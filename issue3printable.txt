THE DAILY HAROLD: LEGNAPPING
<br>
This article features the forced amputation of an appendage, specifically a leg. If your are sensitive to any of those topics, we highly advise you to stop reading immediately.
<br>
We begin todays article with the beginning of the shift, I was a mechanic but I still had plans to add another article to my newspaper so I headed to the library to get my writing supplies.
<br>
After grabbing some everything I would need from the library I ready to leave when John Somethin approached me.
<br>
    John Somethin: "Don't move! I'm gonna be needing that leg!"
<br>
    Harold Mirza: "No you don't! Your going to jail for a long time!"
<br>
    John Somethin: "I'd like to see you try and stop me!"
<br>
John Something then ran at me with his PDA (Personal Data Assistant) in hand, I tried to dodge him but it was to late. I felt my leg get wrenched out of it socket while it detached from my waist. Surprisingly the pain was minimal.
<br>
John Somethin: "Muhahahah! Your leg is mine!"
<br>
Then before I could say anything he vanished in to thin air. I still wonder where my leg is now, if it is happy, if it is sad. I may never know what happened to it and thats one of the things that keeps me up at night. Even if I got treads to replace it I still fell something it missing. Oh how I miss you my dear leg.
