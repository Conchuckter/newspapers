# THE DAILY HAROLD: BRUTAL ATTACK!

### In this issue of the daily Harold I will be recounting the story of how I was brutally assaulted by a so called "head", I will be going to fine detail so if you are sensitive to any parts of this article feel free to stop reading.

#### It starts in the NetCafe where I was getting my writing and printing supplies, I saw Freya Pitts and Tavish Finnnegan hacking the AI doors open, this was very suspicious I thought so I started recording. They pried the doors open and stepped inside where they waited at the second set of doors for them to open. Thats when I stepped towards them, they shouted to get out even though they had closed the doors behind me. I was trapped.

#### They then came towards me each with a flash in hand. They then began to both blind me, during which I collasped due to the repeated bursts of blinding light. Tavish then approached me, baton drawn but shut off and held backwards, they raised it above their head and began to mericlessly beat me, blood was streaming out of my nose and I felt my bones crunch after each blow. When they finally stopped I was barely breathing, soaked in my own blood. Tavish grabbed me and threw me outside while suplexing me, one last count of assault to finish it off. I was then saved by MEDICBOT 9000 whom dragged me to the medbay where I was able to recovering only after being cloned.

#### All I wish to happen is the assaulients to be approprietly punished for their crimes, as a normal crew member. Not a head or a security officer. Just as a normal person. I do hope readers of this issue will help me with this mission, but I wish you all the very best anyhow.
